Welcome the world of computer science hustlers!

It's a project that contributes to the student's and teacher's virtual interaction, supported by MERN stack. It's being developed by the team "byteBenders".

The team consists of the following folks:

It's done as a part of hackathon, conducted by upSkillMafia.
